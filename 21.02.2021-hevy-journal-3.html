    <h1>Hevy Journal #3</h1>
    <div class="content-container">
      <p>
        We had an amazing January in terms of revenue because of the New Years
        promotion and also likely due to new year resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We just finished a 10 day hack-a-thon in Barcelona. We spent it building
        the new Hevy web app. We didnâ€™t quite get it finished like we thought we
        would. We definitely couldnâ€™t move as fast as we did in Portugal. I
        think thereâ€™s a few reasons for this. Mainly itâ€™s because we often
        werenâ€™t only able to focus on the web app. Some time was spent fighting
        fires in the mobile app and a lot of time was spent having higher level
        strategy conversations. Itâ€™s also just impossible to recreate the fire
        ðŸ”¥ we had in Portugal, but I think thatâ€™s normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.0 of the Hevy web app will allow existing users (no signup) to manage
        and share their routines. The first release will have two main benefits:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Give users the ability to manage and change their routines on a big
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an extremely beautiful routine page so that users want to share
          the routines they create.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Weâ€™re currently having to decide if it makes sense to start bringing in
        help for the business. Ryan is already doing development for us 2 days a
        month and weâ€™re considering increasing that. Weâ€™re also thinking about
        bringing on an intern (â‚¬600/month). We need to decide whatâ€™s a good
        investment of our money in terms of growth benefits per euro spent. We
        are also considering the benefits of staying within our current revenue
        limits or if injecting a small amount of capital makes sense to speed up
        growth.
