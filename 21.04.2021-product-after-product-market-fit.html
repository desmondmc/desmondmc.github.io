    <h1>Product After Product Market Fit</h1>
    <div class="content-container">
      <p>
        What’s the point of improving the product after you’ve found product
        market fit?
      </p>
      <p>
        It almost sounds like a stupid question. Of course Improving your
        product is always important, even after you’ve found product market fit.
        This is obvious to most people I think. But to me at least, the answer
        to why wasn’t obvious at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        When my cofounder and I decided we wanted to build Hevy, we took a two
        week vacation to Portugal with the plan to work like crazy for two weeks
        and try to hack out an MVP. In that two week period we managed to build
        a lot of the key features in the app that users still love about it
        today. After two weeks of work, you could log a workout, follow friends,
        get basic analytics etc. We created a lot of value in that two year
        period.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s been 2 years since our trip to Portugal and we’ve been working on
        Hevy ever since. 2 years is enough time for 52 Portugal hack-a-thons.
        You’d think, that in that time we’d be able to add 52 times the value to
        Hevy that we added in the first two weeks in Portugal. But if you look
        at the app now, it’s clear it’s come a long way since the original
        sprint but it’s not THAT different. It’s definitely not 52x different.
        We’ve added, 5 or 6 key features, it’s true, but the core product is
        mostly the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sure seems like the value of product work has diminishing returns as
        time goes on. Meaning for every dollar spent on product we get less and
        less out over time. If that’s true, why work on product at all after you
        have product market fit? Assuming your business has limited resources,
        wouldn’t time and money be better spent on marketing? Maybe the best
        strategy would be to have a bare bones product team just to keep the
        lights on and spend the rest on user acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a serious question we asked ourselves: What’s the point of
        product work after product market fit?
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is this: Product improvements are a value multiplier.If you
        have a product people like it must give them some value. You could
        represent this with a simple equation:
      </p>
      <p>Value Out = User x Product Value</p>
      <p>
        When you find product market fit, it means you’ve brought it to 1.1. A
        successful MVP should be aiming for a 1.1 “Product Value” which will
        result in a 1.1 “Value Out”. Customers get more value with your product
        than without it. It’s true, as time goes on, it gets harder and harder
        to increase the “Product Value” variable, but since it’s a multiplier,
        even small increments make a huge difference in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’re also thresholds you pass as you increase “Value Out”. A product
        with a “Value Out” of 1.1 is a product that you use because you have to.
        You don’t love it, you don’t tell your friends about it, you’re
        reluctant to pay for it and wish there were better alternatives. At >1.5
        you like the product, you’re not looking for alternatives, you’re
        content to pay for it but you also don’t tell your friends about it. At
        >2.0 you’re proud that you use the product, you tell all your friend and
        you feel great about paying for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously a >2.0 “Value Out” product is the promised land. Reaching 2.0
        means you’ve built a world class product. Getting from a 1.1 MVP to 2.0
        is HARD but getting there is worth it at almost any price. That’s why
        product work is worth every dollar spent.
